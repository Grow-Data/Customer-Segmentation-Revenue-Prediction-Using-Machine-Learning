# Customer-Segmentation-Revenue-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on customer segmentation and revenue prediction using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and applying clustering algorithms to identify different customer purchasing behaviors. Additionally, regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are used to predict future sales.

Key Features:

Customer Segmentation: K-Means clustering for RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
Revenue Prediction: Predicting transaction revenue using regression models.
Data Visualization: Insights into revenue trends, customer spending, and purchase frequency.
Machine Learning Models: Performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics.
This project provides actionable insights into customer behavior and helps businesses optimize marketing strategies and revenue forecasting.
